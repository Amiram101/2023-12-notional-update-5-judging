# Immediate payment of REWARD_TOKEN may block most of nToken's operations

## Summary
When `nToken` has a balance change, the protocol will immediately execute `REWARD_TOKEN.transfer()` to the user. 
If `REWARD_TOKEN` has a pause or blacklist mechanism, it will cause all of the user's nToken methods such as mint/withdraw to fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the user's `nToken` balance changes, the following method will be executed:
`any nToken balance change` ->`Incentives.claimIncentives() ` -> `SecondaryRewarder.claimRewards()` -> `REWARD_TOKEN.transfer(user)`
```solidity
    function _claimRewards(
        address account,
        uint16 currencyId,
        uint256 nTokenBalanceBefore,
        uint256 nTokenBalanceAfter,
        uint256 priorNTokenSupply
    ) external override onlyNotional {
...
        if (0 < rewardToClaim) {
@>          GenericToken.safeTransferOut(REWARD_TOKEN, account, rewardToClaim);
            emit RewardTransfer(REWARD_TOKEN, account, rewardToClaim);
        }
```

This poses a significant risk, blocking nToken's operations.
>On Arbitrum, this will be ARB as a result of the ARB STIP grant. In the future, this may be any arbitrary ERC20 token.

1. Many `tokens` have a blacklist mechanism, such as `USDC`.
2. Many `tokens`' `transfer()` will have a pause mechanism.

As long as the above situations occur, it will cause most of `nToken`'s methods to `revert`, such as mint/withdraw/transfer, etc.

These core businesses should not be affected by `SecondaryRewarder`.

It is recommended to use the `claimable[]` method, only recording the amount that can be `claimed`.

The user actively goes to `claim()` and then executes `transfer()`.

## Impact
Immediate payment of REWARD_TOKEN may block most of nToken's operations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the common practice, add `claimable[user]` variable, `_claimRewards()` only records the quantity.

The user actively goes to execute `claim` and then transfers to the user.
