# The rewarder is not called when users redeem their nTokens leading to rewards

## Summary
```solidity
Invariants:
The rewarder must be called on every nToken balance change
```
This is according the the documentation, the `rewarder` should be called on every nToken balance change , the `rewarder` is meant to claim rewards for the users on every nToken balance change.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the code snippet below the `balanceHandler` is called to load the balance state of the `redeemer` which 
loads the  `nTokenBalance` and the redemption continues without calling the `rewarder`
## Impact 
Users will lose rewards

```solidity
function nTokenRedeem(
        address redeemer,
        uint16 currencyId,
        uint96 tokensToRedeem_,
        bool sellTokenAssets,
        bool acceptResidualAssets
    ) external nonReentrant returns (int256, bool) {
        // ERC1155 can call this method during a post transfer event
        require(msg.sender == redeemer || msg.sender == address(this), "Unauthorized caller");
        int256 tokensToRedeem = int256(tokensToRedeem_);

        (AccountContext memory context, /* didSettle */) = _settleAccountIfRequired(redeemer);

//@audit-balanceHandler gets called this logic should call the rewarder 

        BalanceState memory balance;
        balance.loadBalanceState(redeemer, currencyId, context);

        require(balance.storedNTokenBalance >= tokensToRedeem, "Insufficient tokens");
        balance.netNTokenSupplyChange = tokensToRedeem.neg();

        (int256 totalPrimeCash, PortfolioAsset[] memory assets) = nTokenRedeemAction.redeem(
            redeemer, currencyId, tokensToRedeem, sellTokenAssets, acceptResidualAssets
        );

        // Set balances before transferring assets
        balance.netCashChange = totalPrimeCash;
        balance.finalizeNoWithdraw(redeemer, context);

        // The hasResidual flag is only set to true if selling residuals has failed, checking
        // if the length of assets is greater than zero will detect the presence of ifCash
        // assets that have not been sold.
        if (assets.length > 0) {
            // This method will store assets and return the memory location of the new account
            // context.
            address nTokenAddress = nTokenHandler.nTokenAddress(currencyId);
            context = SettleAssetsExternal.placeAssetsInAccount(redeemer, nTokenAddress, context, assets);
        }

        context.setAccountContext(redeemer);
        if (context.hasDebt != 0x00) {
            FreeCollateralExternal.checkFreeCollateralAndRevert(redeemer);
        }

        return (totalPrimeCash, assets.length > 0);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Include the call to the rewarder to claim rewards for the redeemer
