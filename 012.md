# If `UNDERLYING_TOKEN` is USDT, `LENDING_POOL` has to be approved to 0 first before depositUnderlyingAmount

## Summary
USDT needs to be approved to zero first on mainnet.
## Vulnerability Detail
in the _getDepositCalldataForRebalancing() in AaveV3HoldingsOracle.sol contract, if UNDERLYING_TOKEN isn't ETH the LENDING_POOL is approved to depositUnderlyingAmount for the ERC20 token. This will give issues for USDT as it needs approvals to be set to 0 first.
## Impact
`LENDING_POOL` isn't approved to 0 first which is incompatible with USDT.
