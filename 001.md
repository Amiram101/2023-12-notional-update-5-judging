# Unchecked external calls

krkba
## Summary
The function calls `getUnderlyingToken()` and `safeApprove()` without checking the return value or catching potential reverts and it could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if these calls fail.
## Vulnerability Detail
The contract makes external calls to other contracts, If these calls fail silently it could lead to unexpected behavior
## Impact
Unchecked external calls can introduce reentrancy vulnerabilities, enabling an attacker to repeatedly call back into the contract before the initial operation completes, also it might allow attacker to execute calls that consume excessive gas, causing `(DOS)` attack and leading to contract unavailability or network congestion.
