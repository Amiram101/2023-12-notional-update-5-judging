# Incorrect rate used when fCash has not settled yet

## Summary

The assumption that the `pr.supplyFactor` will be zero when the fCash has not yet been settled is incorrect. Instead, the current cash rate is returned if the fCash has not been settled yet. As a result, 

## Vulnerability Detail

Based on the comment in Line 215 below, the code assumes that after maturity, if the `pr.supplyFactor` is zero, the fCash has not yet been settled. Thus, the matured cash value will also be zero.

However, this assumption is incorrect.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-notional-update-5/blob/main/wrapped-fcash/contracts/wfCashBase.sol#L215

```solidity
File: wfCashBase.sol
209:     function _getMaturedCashValue(uint256 fCashAmount) internal view returns (uint256) { 
210:         if (!hasMatured()) return 0; 
211:         // If the fCash has matured we use the cash balance instead.
212:         (uint16 currencyId, uint40 maturity) = getDecodedID(); 
213:         PrimeRate memory pr = NotionalV2.getSettlementRate(currencyId, maturity); 
214: 
215:         // fCash has not yet been settled
216:         if (pr.supplyFactor == 0) return 0; 
217:         require(pr.supplyFactor > 0); 
218: 
219:         return fCashAmount * Constants.DOUBLE_SCALAR_PRECISION / uint256(pr.supplyFactor); 
220:     }
```

Within the `NotionalV2.getSettlementRate` function, it will call `PrimeRateLib.buildPrimeRateSettlementView` function internally.

At Line 356 below, if it has not been settled yet, the `PrimeRateLib._getPrimeSettlementRate` function will return `pr.supplyFactor=0` and `isSet=false`. Subsequently, the code at Line 360 will be executed and the current cash rate will be returned when the settlement rate is not found (fCash not yet settled). `pr.supplyFactor` will be set to a non-zero value, which is the current cash rate.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-notional-update-5/blob/main/contracts-v3/contracts/internal/pCash/PrimeRateLib.sol#L360

```solidity
File: PrimeRateLib.sol
350:     function buildPrimeRateSettlementView(
351:         uint16 currencyId,
352:         uint256 maturity,
353:         uint256 blockTime
354:     ) internal view returns (PrimeRate memory pr) {
355:         bool isSet;
356:         (pr, isSet) = _getPrimeSettlementRate(currencyId, maturity);
357:         
358:         if (!isSet) {
359:             // Return the current cash rate if settlement rate not found
360:             (pr, /* */) = PrimeCashExchangeRate.getPrimeCashRateView(currencyId, blockTime);
361:         }
362:     }
```

Thus, the initial assumption that the `pr.supplyFactor` will be zero when the fCash has not yet been settled is incorrect, and the following check within the `_getMaturedCashValue` function is also incorrect. As a result, the `_getMaturedCashValue` will proceed with the calculation of matured cash value with the incorrect rate (Current cash rate), leading to inaccurate (inflated or deflated) prime cash value being returned. 

The correct rate to use after maturity is the settlement rate instead of the current cash rate.

```solidity
File: wfCashBase.sol
209:     function _getMaturedCashValue(uint256 fCashAmount) internal view returns (uint256) {
..SNIP..
215:         // fCash has not yet been settled
216:         if (pr.supplyFactor == 0) return 0; 
```

## Impact

The affected function (`_getMaturedCashValue`) is being utilized within the `wfCashERC4626.totalAssets` and `wfCashLogic._burnInternal` functions, leading to various issues due to inaccurate (inflated or deflated) prime cash value being returned. 

For instance, `wfCashERC4626.totalAssets() > wfCashERC4626.convertToShares() > wfCashERC4626.previewWithdraw() > withdraw()`, the inaccurate number of shares will be returned from the `previewWithdraw` function within the `withdraw` function, resulting in an inflated or deflated amount of shares being redeemed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To determine if the fCash has been settled yet after maturity, read the `isSet` boolean directly. Consider exposing the `_getPrimeSettlementRate` function so that the wrapper contract can call it directly to obtain the `isSet` boolean.
