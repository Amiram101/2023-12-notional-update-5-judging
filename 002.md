# Token addresses gotten from the deployment script when contracts are deployed on arbitrum will be incorrect.

## Summary
Deployments.sol comments out arbitrum `WETH` and `NOTE` token addresses, therefore functions that call for the addresses will not work. 
## Vulnerability Detail
From the provided information, the contracts will be deployed on mainnet and arbitrum.
> On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?

> mainnet, arbitrum

And from the Deployments.sol contract;

```solidity
library Deployments {
    uint256 internal constant MAINNET = 1;
    uint256 internal constant ARBITRUM_ONE = 42161;
    uint256 internal constant LOCAL = 1337;

    // MAINNET: 0xCFEAead4947f0705A14ec42aC3D44129E1Ef3eD5
    address internal constant NOTE_TOKEN_ADDRESS = 0xCFEAead4947f0705A14ec42aC3D44129E1Ef3eD5;
    // ARBITRUM: 0x019bE259BC299F3F653688c7655C87F998Bc7bC1
    // address internal constant NOTE_TOKEN_ADDRESS = 0x019bE259BC299F3F653688c7655C87F998Bc7bC1;

    // MAINNET: 0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2
    WETH9 internal constant WETH = WETH9(0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2);
    // ARBITRUM: 0x82aF49447D8a07e3bd95BD0d56f35241523fBab1
    // WETH9 internal constant WETH = WETH9(0x82aF49447D8a07e3bd95BD0d56f35241523fBab1);
    // OPTIMISM: 0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006

    // Chainlink L2 Sequencer Uptime: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds/
    // MAINNET: NOT SET
    AggregatorV2V3Interface internal constant SEQUENCER_UPTIME_ORACLE = AggregatorV2V3Interface(address(0));
    // ARBITRUM: 0xFdB631F5EE196F0ed6FAa767959853A9F217697D
    // AggregatorV2V3Interface internal constant SEQUENCER_UPTIME_ORACLE = AggregatorV2V3Interface(0xFdB631F5EE196F0ed6FAa767959853A9F217697D);

```
Note that mainnet chainid, `NOTE` token address, `WETH` address and arbitrum chain id are active. However arbitrum's `WETH` and `NOTE` token addresses are commented out.

## Impact
Functions depending on these addresses, including contracts in and out of scope will have incure unexpected behaviour because the wrong/non existent addresses will be gotten and used from arbiscan.
