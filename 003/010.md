# use SafeTransfer() instead of transfer() in  SecondaryRewarder.reward().

## Summary
transfer() isn't compatible with some tokens and also its return value isn't checked.
## Vulnerability Detail
The return value of transfer() isn't checked in SecondaryRewarder.reward(). 

Also if token to recover is a token like USDT that doesn't return any value there will be issues as they're not compatible.
## Impact
transfer is not compatible with some tokens, there will be issue when handling incompatible tokens like USDT.
