# Unsafe Downcasting of timestamp to uint32 results in eventual Overflow

## Summary

The protocol uses potentially dangerous downcasting to `uint32` in `SecondaryRewarder` contract

## Vulnerability Detail

```Solidity
endTime = uint32(block.timestamp);
```
`Unix timestamps` represent time as seconds elapsed since `January 1, 1970.` The maximum value that can be represented by a `uint32 is 4294967295`, which corresponds to the `Unix timestamp of 12:47:05 GMT` on `Sunday, February 7, 2106.`

Here's a simple illustration in Python:

```Python
import datetime max_uint32 = 2**32 - 1

print(datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(max_uint32)) 
```

Running this script will output: `2106-02-07 12:47:05`, which confirms the overflow will occur on this date.


## Impact

`Downcasting the timestamp to uint32` will cause an overflow and protocol misbehavior on `February 7, 2106.`

Therefore depending on how the protocol uses `timestamps`, it could `fail entirely or become unstable`. For example, where the protocol uses `timestamps` to `order events or to calculate timeouts`, an `incorrect timestamp` could cause events to be `processed out of order or timeouts to occur prematurely`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

> Although the likelihood of this issue is low and the potential threat would appear decades in the future, I recommend using a `bigger data type e.g. uint40`. The gas cost would not increase much, and the protocol will be future-proof.
