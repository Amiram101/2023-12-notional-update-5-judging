# wfCash.sol unable to  retrieve excess prime cash

## Summary
This update added `Minting at Zero Interest`, which will be converted into `primeCash`. 
The excess variable rate interest will simply accrue to the protocol. 
However, `wfCash` does not provide a method to retrieve this excess part of `prime cash`.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. If `mint` at zero interest generates shares at a 1:1 ratio
> The net effect is that the wrapped fCash lender lends at a zero interest rate (i.e., 1 USDC = 1 fUSDC) and the excess variable rate interest will simply accrue to the protocol.
2. If shares are redeemed before maturity, `prime cash` will be deducted at a discount
> Redemptions prior to maturity will sell fCash on the market and return the resulting cash to the account. If the wrapped fCash contract has minted at zero interest, at some point there will be insufficient fCash to sell on the market. In this case, we calculate using the oracle interest rate how much the fCash would sell for and transfer that amount to the account.
3. After maturity, use `shares` fCash amount through `supplyFactor` to calculate the amount of `prime cash`
> Post maturity, fCash will settle to a cash balance. Each account will receive the value of their wrapped fCash shares converted to a prime cash balance. We do not use a pro rata share of the prime cash held by the contract since that may result in a windfall for wrapped fCash holders and encourage MEV type activity.

All three can lead to the final amount of `prime cash` needed to be exchanged back through `wfCash.totalSupply` being less than the `prime cash` balance in the `NOTIONAL` of the `wfCash` address.

But currently, `wfCash` does not provide a method to retrieve this excess part of `prime cash`."

## Impact
excess prime cash be locked in the contract

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add withdraw method
```diff
abstract contract wfCashLogic is wfCashBase, ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable {

+    function recoverPrimeCash() external {
+        // Only the Notional owner can call this method
+        require(msg.sender == NotionalV2.owner());
+        require(hasMatured(),"need mature");
+        NotionalV2.settleAccount(address(this));
+        uint256 cash = getCashBalance();
+        uint256 primeCashValue = _getMaturedCashValue(totalSupply());
+        _withdrawCashToAccount(currencyId, msg.sender, _safeUint88(cash - primeCashValue));
+   }
```
