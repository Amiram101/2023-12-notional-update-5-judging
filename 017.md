# Lack of allowance front-running protection

## Summary
The withdrawViaProxy function allows a spender to potentially withdraw an account's prime cash twice by front-running a call from the account owner to modify the allowance.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `withdrawViaProxy` is allowing users to withdraw someone else's prime cash if they have the necessary allowance. 

[AccountAction.sol#L220-L235](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-notional-update-5/blob/main/contracts-v3/contracts/external/actions/AccountAction.sol#L220-L235)
```solidity
    function withdrawViaProxy(
        uint16 currencyId,
        address account,
        address receiver,
        address spender,
        uint88 withdrawAmountPrimeCash
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
        address pCashAddress = PrimeCashExchangeRate.getCashProxyAddress(currencyId);
        require(msg.sender == pCashAddress);
        requireValidAccount(account);


        if (account != spender) {
            uint256 allowance = LibStorage.getPCashTransferAllowance()[account][spender][currencyId];
            require(allowance >= withdrawAmountPrimeCash, "Insufficient allowance");
            LibStorage.getPCashTransferAllowance()[account][spender][currencyId] = allowance - withdrawAmountPrimeCash;
        }
```

However, if the account owner decides to change the allowance of the spender using `nTokenTransferApprove`, he will risk being front-run by the spender who could call `withdrawViaProxy` to spend the current allowance, wait for the account owner's transaction to go through and then call `withdrawViaProxy` to spend the new allowance.

[nTokenAction.sol#L103-L115](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-notional-update-5/blob/main/contracts-v3/contracts/external/actions/nTokenAction.sol#L103-L115)
```solidity
    function nTokenTransferApprove(
        uint16 currencyId,
        address tokenHolder,
        address spender,
        uint256 amount
    ) external override returns (bool) {
        address nTokenAddress = nTokenHandler.nTokenAddress(currencyId);
        require(msg.sender == nTokenAddress);
        require(tokenHolder != address(0));


        nTokenAllowance[tokenHolder][spender][currencyId] = amount;
        return true;
    }
```

## Impact
A user withdrawing on behalf of someone else will be able to spend two allowances if the account owner wants to change the balance to a non zero value.

## Code Snippet
See above.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a mechanism to increase or decrease the allowance or force a user to reset the allowance before setting a new one in two transactions.
