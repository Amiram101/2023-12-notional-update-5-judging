# Lack of Validation for 'newBalance' in setReserveCashBalance Function

## Summary

The function `setReserveCashBalance` at  [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-notional-update-5/blob/main/contracts-v3/contracts/external/actions/TreasuryAction.sol#L101) has an issue


`NOTE`: This does not fall under the sherlock's [rules](https://docs.sherlock.xyz/audits/judging/judging) number `5` but rather an issue that's clearly  written in `natspec` and probably forgotten to be implemented,  so i request that the sponsors be made aware of this.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `setReserveCashBalance` is used to update or set a reserve currency balance and its used in case of `insolvency` , the issues here is that there is a potential misalignment with the docs(natspec in this case), the `natspecs`  clearly stated that the `newBalance` must be less than current balance as:
```solidity
// @notice This is used in the case of insolvency. It allows the owner to re-align the reserve with its correct balance.
    /// @param currencyId refers to the currency of the reserve
this -->    /// @param newBalance new reserve balance to set, must be less than the current balance
    // @audit must be less than the current balance not checked?
    function setReserveCashBalance(uint16 currencyId, int256 newBalance) external override onlyOwner {
        _checkValidCurrency(currencyId);
        // newBalance cannot be negative and is checked inside BalanceHandler.setReserveCashBalance
        BalanceHandler.setReserveCashBalance(currencyId, newBalance);
    }
```

i dont know the logic(or yet to graps) behind this but since its stated in the docs(natspec) then there is a chance that it must have been forgotten to be checked. I traced down the called function ( `setReserveCashBalance`) and i notice that there was a checked to make sure that its not zero but nothing sort of the `currentBalance` (previous balance):
```solidity
function setReserveCashBalance(uint16 currencyId, int256 newBalance) internal {
        require(newBalance >= 0); // dev: invalid balance
        int256 previousBalance = getPositiveCashBalance(Constants.FEE_RESERVE, currencyId);
        _setPositiveCashBalance(Constants.FEE_RESERVE, currencyId, newBalance);
        Emitter.emitMintOrBurnPrimeCash(Constants.FEE_RESERVE, currencyId, newBalance.sub(previousBalance));
    }
```

You can see here that `previousBalance `  was  initiated but was never checked as specify in the natspec

## Impact

The impact lies in the underlying of what the developer might be thinking will happen if not checked, thats why i request that they should be made aware of.

## Recommendation

The developers should add the check for the new balance  and make sure that it does not lead to an unexpected behavior
