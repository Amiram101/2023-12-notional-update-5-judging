# Unsafe casting from unit96 to int256 will cause overflow/underflow, overflow checks aren't implicit  in solidity 0.7.6

## Summary
there is a potential risk of overflow/underflow when casting the ` tokensToRedeem_`  value, which is of type  `uint96` , to an ` int256` , especially considering that the variable is user-controlled.

-Overflow: If the original  `uint96` value is greater than the maximum value that can be represented by an ` int256  (2^255 - 1)`, an overflow will occur when casting. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially incorrect results.

-Underflow: If the original  `uint96`  value is negative (i.e., it's interpreted as a large unsigned integer rather than a positive integer), there may be an underflow when casting to ` int256` . This could result in the new  `int256` value being interpreted as a large negative number, which may not be the intended outcome.

A check is required if `uint96`  value falls within the range representable by an  `int256`  to avoid overflow or underflow issues
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function nTokenRedeem(
        address redeemer,
        uint16 currencyId,
        uint96 tokensToRedeem_,
        bool sellTokenAssets,
        bool acceptResidualAssets
    ) external nonReentrant returns (int256, bool) {
        // ERC1155 can call this method during a post transfer event
        require(msg.sender == redeemer || msg.sender == address(this), "Unauthorized caller");
        int256 tokensToRedeem = int256(tokensToRedeem_);
```

The `redeemer` can input a value greater than the acceptable range of  `int256` overflow/underflow will occur in one of the two cases
-If the  `uint96`  value being cast is greater than `2^255 - 1` (the maximum positive value of  `int256 `), overflow will occur when casting to  `int256` .
-If the ` uint96` value is negative (i.e., greater than `2^255`), it will be interpreted as a very large positive number when cast to ` int256` , potentially leading to unexpected behavior
## Impact
Depending on the `redeemer` motive they can input a higher value to trigger the overflow and earn more tokens than they have 
Or 
Input a negative value to disrupt the system calculation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Perform a range check before casting.

```solidity

function nTokenRedeem(
    address redeemer,
    uint16 currencyId,
    uint96 tokensToRedeem_,
    bool sellTokenAssets,
    bool acceptResidualAssets
) external nonReentrant returns (int256, bool) {
    // ERC1155 can call this method during a post transfer event
    require(msg.sender == redeemer || msg.sender == address(this), "Unauthorized caller");

    //@audit- Perform validation check for potential overflow
    require(tokensToRedeem_ <= type(int256).max, "Tokens to redeem exceed safe range for conversion");

    int256 tokensToRedeem = int256(tokensToRedeem_);
    // Rest of the function logic...
}
