# Potential issues caused by the current implementation of the catch-block inside `wfCashERC4626._previewDeposit()`

## Summary

Inside `wfCashERC4626._previewDeposit()` there is a catch-block (line 105 wfCashERC4626.sol) which assigns `maxFCash` to the amount of `shares` the user receives. This may lead to issues.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user deposits `assets` by using `wfCashERC4626.deposit()`, the amount of `shares` minted for the user is calculated (line 190 wfCashERC4626.sol) by calling `wfCashERC4626._previewDeposit()`.

Inside `wfCashERC4626._previewDeposit()` there is a try-catch (line 95-106 wfCashERC4626.sol). There, if the call to `CalculationViews.getfCashLendFromDeposit()` fails, `maxFCash` is assigned to `shares` inside the catch block (line 105 wfCashERC4626.sol), which may cause issues.

Example:

When depositing 0 assets with `wfCashERC4626.deposit()`, a user may receive `maxFCash` shares.

* `CalculationViews.getfCashLendFromDeposit()` is calling `CalculationViews._convertDepositAmountToUnderlyingInternal` (line 342 CalculationViews.sol).
* There the calculation of `underlyingInternal` is based on the `depositAmountExternal` parameter which is the deposited amount of `assets`. If a user deposits 0 amount of `assets`, `underlyingInternal` will be calculated to be 0 due to a multiplication by 0.
* When `underlyingInternal` is 0 it triggers a revert inside `InterestRateCurve.getfCashGivenCashAmount()` on line 562 inside InterestRateCurve.sol.

* Note: Trace is `wfCashERC4626.deposit() -> wfCashERC4626._previewDeposit() -> CalculationViews.getfCashLendFromDeposit() -> CalculationViews._getfCashAmountGivenCashAmount_() -> InterestRateCurve.getfCashGivenCashAmount() -> revert into catch-block of wfCashERC4626._previewDeposit()`.

* After the revert is triggered inside `InterestRateCurve.getfCashGivenCashAmount()` as described above, the catch-block inside `wfCashERC4626._previewDeposit()` is invoked (line 105 wfCashERC4626.sol).

* There `maxFCash` is assigned to `shares`. As a result, despite that the user deposited 0 `assets`, they will receive `maxFCash` `shares` which are subsequently minted for the user when `wfCashERC4626._mintInternal()` is invoked on line 192 in wfCashERC4626.sol.

## Impact

As shown in the example above, a user may receive `maxFCash` shares for depositing 0 `assets`, by calling `wfCashERC4626.deposit()` with a value of 0 for the `assets` function param, thus effectively stealing assets from other depositors.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adjusting `wfCashERC4626.deposit()` to revert when a user passes in 0 `assets`.

Also consider adjusting the catch-block inside `wfCashERC4626._previewDeposit()`, where it may be necessary to distinguish between different use-cases (and different potential reverts) in order to handle them accordingly. There are some use cases where it makes sense to assign `maxFCash` to `shares`, but there are also certain cases which should be handled differently in order to avoid further exploits.
