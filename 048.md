# Merkle root can be set before the detachment

## Summary

The Merkle root can set before the detachment, potentially causing issues when claiming rewards later.

## Vulnerability Detail

Per the comment on Line 144, it mentioned that this function should only be called after the rewarder is detached. However, there is no control to enforce this requirement.

```solidity
File: SecondaryRewarder.sol
142:     /// @notice Set merkle root, only called after rewarder is detached
143:     /// @param _merkleRoot merkle root of the tree that contains accounts and nToken balances at detach time
144:     function setMerkleRoot(bytes32 _merkleRoot) external onlyOwner { 
145:         require(_merkleRoot != bytes32(0), "Invalid"); 
146:         merkleRoot = _merkleRoot;
147:     }
```

The Merkle root can only be set once. Assume the Merkle root is set (intentionally or accidentally) to $A$ before the detachment.  After the detachment, the balance of the accounts changes and the root $A$ is no longer valid. However, at this stage, it is no longer possible for the owner to set the Merkle root to the correct root $B$ and the users will not be able to claim the rewards, or the users will have to claim against outdated balances.

## Impact

If the Merkle root is set before detachment, users might have issues claiming rewards, as mentioned above.

## Recommendation

Ensure that the rewarder is detached before allowing anyone to set the Merkle root.

```diff
function setMerkleRoot(bytes32 _merkleRoot) external onlyOwner { 
	require(_merkleRoot != bytes32(0), "Invalid"); 
+	require(detached);	
	merkleRoot = _merkleRoot;
}
```
